# CodeNode

In this repo, I have recorded the code that I practiced to learn Node.js/ Exu. 

I hope everyone will benefit from this repo.

## How to Use It

Get to the Specific Day.

Make a new folder. 

Pull this repo.

Go line by line, uncomment the code written under it.

After fully understanding it, move over to the next line, and comment the previous code again.

For every change you make in the code, you have to stop the previous version from running on Chrome by pressing `Ctrl + C`. 

Then, press the up arrow key, and before entering, please save your code.

## Here's Your Progress

If you feel stuck somewhere, feel free to contact me, either on LinkedIn or on Instagram; I don't mind.

Happy Hacking...
